That was the day that, in almost 20 cities, hundreds of people took to the streets to protest the proposition of then-minister of industry and commerce Jan Mladek to break the ecological limits of brown coal extraction in the Bílina and ČSA mines. The expansion of the ČSA mine would have also meant the destruction of the town of Horní Jiřetín , which lay at the edge of the existing mine. Those protests brought the issues of coal extraction and burning and their impact on the environment and climate into the public debate.</p><p>We organized a similar action in the same year in June. We got over 20 cities, both from Czechia and abroad, to join us, and over a thousand people took to the streets. Most of them were from Litvínov, Prague, Brno, and of course Horní Jiřetín. Thoughout the campaign to preserve the limits of extraction, we also organized a few happenings. The best one was in front of the house of one of the coal barons, Jan Dienstl, in Třebívlice, where we started his morning by playing a loud recording of an excavator at work. The success of this campaign may be evidenced by the fact that later an angry Dienstl called one of our members and asked us to leave him alone. We didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>The campaign to preserve the limits ended with a demonstration at the government retreat in Ústí nad Labe, where the ministers approved breaking the limits of extraction in the Bílina mine. Through our collective effort, we saved Jiřetín, but the post-communist consensus about extraction limits was no more and we entered a new era. After this partially successful campaign, we decided to continue and transform ourselves into a climate justice movement. This was one of the reasons that we, along with other organizations, organized a climate march the evening before an important climate meeting in Paris. The very first Czech climate march attracted around 500 people.</p><p>Many of us were at the critical climate conference in Paris in person, including actions and protests. The Paris conference wasn&rsquo;t very pivotal in terms of climate protection, but was pivotal in terms of defining our tactics as a movement. From Paris we know that we cannot trust politicians, because their thirty year effort led to an agreement that even if fully honoured would mean an average warming of the planet of 2.7 degrees compared to preindustrial conditions. We therefore entered 2016 with the understanding that we ourselves have to be the limits of the fossil fuel industry.</p><h4 id=2016>2016</h4><p>The most important month for our development as a movement was May. We decided to organize a bus trip from Czechia to the largest climate justice direct action - Ende Gelände in German Lausitz. We managed to get about 70 people to join us. They joined with around 4,000 brave people who blocked the excavators at Welzow Sud with their bodies. For three days, we worked together to block the excavators in the mine, as well as blocking the tracks to the Schwarze pumpe coal-powered electric plant. The atmosphere of the German Climate camp was so inspiring to us that we decided to have our own Climatecamp in Czechia in the summer of 2016. We also started to define ourselves as a non-hierarchical open movement and started to organize our own open plenums.</p><h4 id=2017>2017</h4><p>In the first half of the year we organized a few smaller happenings that were meant to draw attention to the most critical problems regarding the excavation and burning of coal. One of the most successful was the die-in at the local government building in Pardubice, which was meant to draw attention to the slowness of the officials who participated in breaking the rules when modernizing the Chvaletice electrical plant. We also joined the campaign against the privatization of the Počerady electrical plant into the hands of the coal barons Tykač and Dienstl, who would have continued operating it for the next decades. Thanks in part to public pressure, we were able to stop the privatization.</p><p>In June, after a month of organizing, we had our first Climatecamp, which took place symbolically in the town of Horní Jiřetín, a municipality that had spent years defending itself against the demolition that would have resulted had the expansion of the ČSA mine been granted. For five days, our Climatecamp became an open space to share experiences and information with the help of workshops and lectures, and an inspiration for a sustainable lifestile. The camp was attended by around 250 people.</p><p>After 3 days full of talks and workshops, our participants joined the protests against the coal industry. First, we went on a march around the boundary of the ČSA mine, to show that the limits of extraction aren&rsquo;t possible to break. After that, 140 of us chose to practice civil disobedience and blocked the excavators in the Bílina coal mine. The first year of Climatecamp was very successful and was a good sign for the future. The climate justice movement was beginning to grow. We also joined two Ende Gelände actions that took place in July and October in German Rhineland.</p><h4 id=2018>2018</h4><p>During the next summer, we decided to take part in a divestmant campaign. As a show of solidarity with people from Hrádek nad Nisou, who are in danger of having insufficient water due to the expansion of the giant nearby Turów mine, which extracts water at the expense of the nearby residents. Together with other organizations we formed a human chain at the Czech-German-Polish border, where together with the locals we showed that the Turów mine needs to end, both for climate reasons and for water reasons.</p><p>In May we organized 14 days for climate. We were joined by various other organizations and collectives through smaller, local actions that drew attention to the climate crisis threat and the need to quickly get rid of our dependence on coal and other fossil fuels.</p><p>Of course, our main action was the third year of Climatecamp, which took place this time near the Chvaletice coal plant. The owners of the mine were asking for an exception to the emission limits, in order to keep polluting the air and deepening the climate crisis. Hundreds of people blocked the entry to the plant itself, where we slept for three nights and requested the end of its operations. The end of coal needs to happen now if we are to avoid the main impacts of the climate crisis.</p><p>In November we continued with a direct action in Most, where we adorned the house of the owner of the Chvaletice    Severní Energetická plant with banners reading &ldquo;The end of coal, without exception&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seven - we ruin the climate day and night&rdquo;.</p><h4 id=2020>2020</h4><p>The future is unwritten. Come write it with us. Join the climate justice movement and help us end the era of coal. Because until the last coal plant and last mine is closed, we are the limits!</p></div></article></main><div class=layout__second-sidebar></div><footer class="footer layout__footer"><p>This site is licensed under some licence</p><p>My jsme limity</p></footer></div><div class=mobile-nav dir=ltr><div class=mobile-nav__cover></div><div class=mobile-nav__sheet><div class=mobile-nav__region><h2 class=visually-hidden>Language selector</h2><nav class="language-selector layout__language-selector"><ul class=navbar><li><a rel=alternate href=/limityjsmemy.cz/cs hreflang=cs lang=cs>Česky</a></li><li><a rel=alternate href=/limityjsmemy.cz/de hreflang=de lang=de>Deutsch</a></li></ul></nav></div><nav class=mobile-nav__main-menu><h2 class=visually-hidden>Main menu</h2><ul class=mobile-nav__navbar><li><a href=/limityjsmemy.cz/en/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/limityjsmemy.cz/en/about-us/ class=active aria-current=page>About us</a></li><li><a href=/limityjsmemy.cz/en/get-involved/>Get involved</a></li><li><a href=/limityjsmemy.cz/en/contact/>Contact</a></li><li><a href=/limityjsmemy.cz/en/events/>Events</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></body></html>
