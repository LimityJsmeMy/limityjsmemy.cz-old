This place has been inhabited since ancient times. This was proven when the settlement 'Valy' ('Валы') was found here on the river Islach. In the 16th century these ruins were used as a platform for feudal castle building. The Rakov castle can be found on the map created by Tomash Makovski in 1613. In the 14th century documents, settlements near contemporary Rakov are mentioned for the first time. Rakov itself is mentioned in 15th century chronicles.
