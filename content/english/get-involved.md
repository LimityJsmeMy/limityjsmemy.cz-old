title: Get involved
---

**Be a limit of the fossil fuel industry!**

We are a non-hierarchical, open organization. This means that we don't have bosses or managers - we make all of our decisions collectively, anyone can get involved and anyone - from cooks to photographers -- can find a way to contribute. Once every two months or so, we hold an open plenum, where we decide on the most critical matters regarding the movement. The easiest way to get involved is to join one of our working groups, which are specifically focused on different areas of our activity. 

## Join a working group. 

We have the following long-term working groups:

### Building the movement

The goal of the "Building the movement" group is to gain the support of different parts of society for our activities, whether it's specifically getting ready for Climatecamps, recruiting new folks to join us, or other work. Here, you can learn to organize talks and screenings, find out what it's like to speak publicly, or come up with creative engagement strategies. 

#### Typical tasks in this group:

Organize a talk, help distribute leaflets and posters, come up with your own geocache for the geocaching project.

### Communication
The communication group takes care of all the online and written communications of the We are the Limits movement. This includes moderating our social media and website, coming up with communication strategies for the whole movement as well as for individual actions, making graphics, flyers, posters, or texts, sending our newsletter, coming up with our fundraising campaign, public appeals, interfacing with media, writing news releases, working on press conferences. For Climatecamp we prepare a camp brochure, media strategy, or a press conference for media. In this group you can learn to write impactful texts, make graphics, manage social media or improve your ability to communicate with journalists. 

#### Typical tasks in this group:
Take care of our Facebook/Twitter/Instagram for two weeks, do the graphic design for our Climatecamp posters, write a press release, write a newsletter, come up with a finance campaign (in collaboration with our Finance team). 

#### Law
Our law group takes care of everything relating to the law and the legal dimensions of our work. They create    legal analyses, train folks before our actions, provide legal advice during actions, provide legal counsel and assistance after our actions. They also communicate with the police. In this group you don't need a law degree - much of the work is coordination. You'll learn here how the law works and you'll improve your ability to communicate with lawyers and police officers. 

#### Typical tasks in this group:
Answer questions in our law emails, communicate with our lawyer, facilitate a legal education workshop. 

### Finance
The financial group tries to raise funds for our activities, tracks them (including creating budgets, accounting, cashflow), communicates with donors (people and institutions) and encourages a culture of responsible finance management in the movement. In this group you can learn to manage money, build our budget, or write grants. 

#### Typical tasks in this group:
Write a grant for a non-profit, come up with a fundraising campaign, track our accounting and expense sheets

### Logistics
The logistics group manages all our materials and ensures a safe Climatecamp. It forms in the weeks and months before Climatecamp and slowly absorbs most of the members of the movement. The logistics group ensures water, electricity, toilets, showers, tents, lighting, etc. In this group you can learn plenty of practical skills, that you will use even in daily life. 

#### Typical tasks in this group:
Figure out how to get water to the Climatecamp, coordinate finding tents for Climatecamp, come up with a ground plan for setting up tents in Climatecamp

### Chillax 
The chillax group aims to monitor the mental and physical state of our members. The fight for climate justice is a long haul, and so the chillax group tries to come up with ways to make our activism sustainable. They have regular meetings, where we talk about things that bug us in the movement. They help people, who for whatever reason don't feel well, and try to come up with strategies to change the world and have fun doing it. In this group you'll learn a lot about techniques to make activism as sustainable and pleasant as possible. 

#### Typical tasks in this group:
Organize a meeting, come up with a way to energise our plena, organize a trip for people from the movement. 

### Safety 
The safety group ensures that the movement is safe from negative influences from outside of our organization. It helps set up safety rules, organizes regular trainings in cybersafety (so-called cryptoparties) and at Climatecamp it ensures the safety of all participants. In this group you can improve your ability to change the world without being stopped by a higher power (we also call them the blue team sometimes...)

#### Typical tasks in this group:
Organize a cryptoparty, come up with rules for safe behaviour in the group's communication channels. 

### Strategy
The strategy group aims to follow events concerning coal and prepare materials for our strategic decisionmaking. It follows live issues, that we can be active in, and communicates with our allies. In this group you can learn a lot about the coal situation in Czechia and try out strategic thinking in the context of an organization. 

#### Typical tasks in this group:
Join the call of the coalition against the sale of the Počerady electrical plant and make notes, follow the developments in the issue of the exception for limits of pollution for the Chvaletice coal plant. 

### Engaging new people
Our goal is for the climate justice movement in Czechia to grow. It's therefore critical to know how to engage new people in our movement. The engagement group therefore takes care of people who want to join the movement. It gives them all the relevant information, helps them feel welcome at our plenum, or connects them with working groups. 

#### Typical tasks in this group:
Organize a talk at the beginning of the plenum about how the movement works and how to behave at the plenum, answer emails of people who want to join us

## Come to the plenum

A plenum happens once every month and a half in different parts of Czechia. Look at our Facebook and come to the next one. If you don't have Facebook, sign up for our newsletter on our website.

## Make a local group
In Brno and Prague there are regular meetings of local groups. You can find out more about them on Facebook. We also have many members in northern Bohemia, in Ostrava, Olomouc, Jihlava and other cities. We can connect you with them, or help you organize something where nothing exists yet. 

## Be online
Follow us on Facebook Instagram, and Twitter and share our content. Join the (Czech-speaking) Protizměnám klimatu, za klimatickou spravedlnost! group on
